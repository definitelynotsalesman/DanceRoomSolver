# DanceRoomSolver
A simple ChatTriggers module to complete the Dance Room in the Rift in Hypixel Skyblock. All of the movement logic was done by @appable0, but from my personal experience the module no longer activated correctly. 
This is a brute force fix but is entirely functional for the average Skyblock player given the effort it would take otherwise. 
In order for this ChatTriggers module to work, ensure that you have imported CTAutocomplete in your ChatTriggers module. 
Additionally, you will want to run /ct reload from the moment you enter the dance room and begin the sequence at around 94% reloaded. I have lower ping than most players so you may have to start much earlier than I did. After you move to the 2nd
glass block, the program should do the rest on its own.

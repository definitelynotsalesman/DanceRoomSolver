# DanceRoomSolver
A simple ChatTriggers module to complete the Dance Room in the Rift in Hypixel Skyblock. All of the movement logic was done by @appable0, but from my personal experience the module no longer activated correctly. 
This is a brute force fix by having the solver run from the moment you enter the Mirrorverse but is entirely functional for the average Skyblock player given the effort it would take otherwise. 

Consequently, you will want to have cleared the rooms at least to the point where you can teleport to the dancer room, otherwise you will begin the sequences in the waiting room. 

You will want to run /ct reload from the moment you enter the dance room and begin the sequence at around 94% reloaded. I have lower ping than most players so you may have to start much earlier than I did. After you move to the 2nd
glass block, the program should do the rest on its own. 

If you fail to start with proper timing, simply type /ct reload again and try again, adjusting your timing depending on if you were late or early. The messages in chat should help guide you towards this answer. 

***If you get stuck in barrier blocks, warp out immediately to not risk a ban.***

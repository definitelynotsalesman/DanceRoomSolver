# DanceRoomSolver
A simple ChatTriggers module to complete the Dance Room in the Rift in Hypixel Skyblock. All of the movement logic was done by @appable0, but I believed the module was no longer functional as they may have modified the move message. 
In order for this module to work, ensure that you have imported CTAutocomplete in your chattriggers module. 
Additionally, you will want to run /ct reload from the moment you enter the dance room and begin the sequence at around 94%. I have lower ping than most players so you may have to start much earlier than I did.
